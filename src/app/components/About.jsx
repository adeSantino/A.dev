          Hello! I'm a passionate web developer skilled in building efficient, clean, and user-friendly digital experiences. My journey started with a strong curiosity about how websites and systems work, and over time, I've developed a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I specialize in building modern web applications using <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, and <strong>Laravel</strong>, and I also have experience in <strong>Python</strong> for backend development and scripting. My focus is on writing scalable, maintainable code and creating seamless user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends, improving my skills in graphic design, or learning new technologies. I’m always open to new challenges and eager to grow as a developer.
